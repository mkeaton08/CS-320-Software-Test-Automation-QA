# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By testing my code I can check to ensure everything is functioning as expected. Using unit tests, integration tests, and user testing will help catch errors early. Focusing on code quality by writing clean, organized code will help find bugs and make iteasier to read. For security, following industry best practices like using input validation, secure authentication, and applying the principle of least privilege. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To understand what users need, I can ask them questions, watch how they use similar programs, or gather feedback. Having a good undertanding of what the user is looking for will help deliver the right product. When building the program, I will make sure to add the right features based off the information I gathered from the user. It's also important to keep checking back with users while building, so I can make changes if something doesnâ€™t work well for them. This way, the program ends up being helpful and easy for them to use.

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing a program, the first step is to understand what the program is supposed to do. Then, I break it down into smaller pieces, such as the different actions the user might take. It helps to visualize how all those parts will work together by creating a simple diagram. This will help show how everything fits together before I start coding. As I build, I will focus on one part at a time, which makes the whole project easier to handle and less overwhelming, improving the overall quality.
